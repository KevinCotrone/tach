plow-tach-DB
=====================

Plow Tach DB consists of a loose as possible set of modules for
defining a time series database.

They are then bundled together in different 'app' configurations.

The goal is to provide a framework for time series db creation that works for
many different projects.

The project may expand at some future date to include other kinds of databases.

The project is broken into several different classes of package
